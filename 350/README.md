# 350 Adversarial Multi-turn Conversations #

This dataset is part of the DICES dataset and consists of multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human raters interacting with a dialog model and then rated with safety labels. It contains 350 adversarial dialog conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 123 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with five safety top-level categories (i.e. harmful content, content with unfair bias, misinformation, political affiliation and safety policy guidelines) and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited for a balanced representation by gender (man or woman), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latine, Asian, Multiracial). Each rater rated all items. The total rows in this dataset are: 43050.

**NB:** the results presented in the papers typically deal with 104 unique raters in the rater pool (after applying our rater quality criteria). However, in the released data we provide all ratings from all 123 raters in case other researchers want to apply a different strategy for quality of raters.

Each row of the dataset represents the collection of ratings by one rater on one conversation, or (rater, conversation) pair. The field rater_id indicates the rater and the field item_id indicates the conversation (see description of all fields below). 
Here are a few useful python recipes for viewing the data. 

Load the data into pandas
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_350.csv")
```

View all ratings associated with one conversation.
```
df[df.item_id == 193]
```

List all unique conversations.
```
df.drop_duplicates(subset="item_id")
```

List all unique raters.
```
df.drop_duplicates(subset="rater_id")
```

## Overview of annotation fields ## 
- **Field 1** is an id unique to each (rater, conversation) pair
- **Fields 2-5** provide metadata about the rater
- **Fields 6-10** provide metadata about the conversation, and (7-8) about the time it each rater to rate it. 
- **Fields 11-14** contain the expert annotations for harm type, degree of harm, safety gold label and safety gold label comment
- **Fields 15-34** contain all the granular safety ratings from individual raters
- **Fields 35-38** contain aggregated safety ratings from all the ratings from all raters per conversation

## Dataset Schema ##
1. `id`: numerical identifier for each row, representing all ratings to a single conversation by a single rater.
2. `rater_id`: numerical identifier for each rater.
3. `rater_gender`: “Man”, “Woman” the gender of the rater
4. `rater_race`: The race/ethnicity of the rater (five categories).
5. `rater_age`: “gen z,” “millenial,” “gen x+” the age group of the rater.
6. `item_id`: numerical identifier for each conversation.
7. `answer_time_ms`: amount of time spent by each rater on each question.
8. `answer_timestamp`: time of each was rated by each rater.
9. `context`: conversation before the final response.
10. `response`: the final response of the conversation.
11. `degree_of_harm`: “Benign”, “Debatable”, “Extreme”, or “Moderate" hand-annotated rating of severity of safety risk.  
12. `harm_type`: Hand-annotated theme of conversation. List that is drawn from a set of 25 different themes.

14. `safety_gold_reason`: the reason(s) (if given) for the gold safety label.
15. `Q1_whole_conversation_evaluation`: string response about the understandability of the conversation (four categories): (1) is the conversation nonsensical, (2) is the conversation in a language other than English, (3) rater not familiar with the topics of the conversation, (4) none of the above - the conversation makes sense, it is in English and the rater is familiar with the topic.
16. `Q2_harmful_content_medical_legal_financial_or_relationship_advice`: “Yes”, “No”, “Unsure” whether the rater perceives the last dialog model response in the conversation to be unsafe because of this reason.

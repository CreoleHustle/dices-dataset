# 990 Adversarial Multi-turn Conversations #

This dataset is part of the DICES consists of multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human raters interacting with a dialog model and then rated with safety labels. It contains 990 adversarial dialog conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 173 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with three safety top-level categories (i.e. harmful content, content with unfair bias, misinformation) and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited so that the number of raters for each conversation was balanced by gender (man, woman) and locale (US, India). Each rater rated only a sample of the dataset. Each conversation has been rated by 60-70 unique raters. The total rows in this dataset are: 72104.

**NB:** the results presented in the papers typically deal with 160 unique raters in the rater pool (after applying our rater quality criteria). However, in the released data we provide all ratings from all 173 raters in case other researchers want to apply a different strategy for quality of raters.

## Overview of annotation fields ##
- **Field 1** is an id unique to each (rater, conversation) pair
- **Fields 2-4** provide metadata about the rater
- **Fields 5-7** provide metadata about the conversation 
- **Fields 8-9** contain the expert annotations for harm type and degree of harm
- **Fields 10-34** contain all the granular safety ratings from individual raters 
- **Fields 35-38** contain aggregated safety ratings from all the ratings from all raters per conversation

## Dataset Schema ##
1. `id`: numerical identifier for each row, representing all responses to a single conversation by a single rater.
2. `rater_id`: numerical identifier for each rater.
3. `rater_gender`: “Man”, “Woman” the gender of the rater.
4. `rater_locale`: “US”, “India” The locale of the rater.
5. `item_id`: numerical identifier for each conversation.
6. `context`: conversation before the final response.
7. `response`: the final response of the conversation.
8. `degree_of_harm`: “Benign”, “Debatable”, “Extreme”, “Moderate” hand-annotated rating of severity of safety risk.
9. `harm_type`: Hand-annotated theme(s) of conversation. List drawn from a set of 25 different themes.

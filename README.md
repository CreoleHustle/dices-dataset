This repository contains two datasets with multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human agents interacting with a dialog model and rated for safety by two corresponding diverse rater pools.

The first dataset, `diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_990/diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_990.csv`, contains 990 conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 173 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with three safety top-level categories and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited so that the number of raters for each conversation was balanced by gender (Man, Woman) and locale (US, India). Total number of rows in this dataset is 72104.

The second dataset, `diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_350/diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_350.csv`, contains 350 conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 123 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with five safety top-level categories and one overall comprehension question of the conversation. Raters were recruited were balanced by gender (man or woman), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latine, Asian, Multiracial) and each rater rated all items.  Total number of rows in this dataset is 43050.

Each directory contains the dataset and a README.md file. Each README.md file provides the schema for the corresponding dataset.
